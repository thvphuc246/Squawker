# Squawker

This is an exercise repository for the Squawker example app which is part of Udacity's Advanced Android course. The Squawker example app uses Firebase Cloud Messenger to receive Twitter-like messages, sent from [this server](https://squawkerfcmserver.udacity.com/), in real time. 

This is the toy app for the FCM lesson of the [Advanced Android App Development course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/advanced-android-app-development--ud855).
